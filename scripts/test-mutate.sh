# Tests for `scripts/mutate.sh run` (AF-284).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: amux verified `run` by using it, and scoped their
# sign-off precisely — they exercised apply, the failing-command path, the
# revert, and the ambiguity refusal, but NOT the killed-by-timeout path or the
# trap-disarm on double-fire. Those two are exactly the cells the author got
# wrong on the first attempt, and they are the reason the tool is safe on a
# shared checkout: a killed command must still revert, exactly once.
#
# Author-only verification of the most safety-critical path is what the peer
# gate exists to prevent, so the fix is not to argue about it — it is to make
# the cells runnable by anyone.

# AF-562: the four `if ... then rc=0; else rc=$?; fi` captures below wrap commands
# whose NON-ZERO STATUS IS THE ASSERTION. Under `set -e` a bare `cmd; rc=$?`
# aborts before the capture. `if` is the set -e-safe form; `|| true` is NOT,
# because it would discard the exact value the next line tests. pipefail
# Overridable so the cells below can be run against a DELIBERATELY BROKEN copy,
# which is how they get shown to fail. Never mutate mutate.sh in place to do
# that: bash reads a running script incrementally, so editing the file being
# executed corrupts the running shell ("unexpected EOF"), and the test then
# passes for a reason that has nothing to do with the code.

# 3. THE TOOL ITSELF IS KILLED — the cell amux did not exercise, and the whole
#    reason the trap exists. A killed `mutate.sh` must still revert, and the trap
#    must DISARM so it reverts exactly ONCE: without the disarm, TERM fires the
#    trap and then EXIT fires it again, the second pass finds 0 occurrences and
#    prints "NOT applied" — a failed-restore message after a SUCCESSFUL restore.
#    The file is correct either way; only the message lies, which is the failure
#    this tool exists to prevent, one layer up.
#
#    THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS CELL DID NOT TEST THE TRAP AT ALL. It ran
#    `-- timeout 1 sleep 5`, which kills the CHILD; mutate.sh survives, sees exit
#    124 and takes its ordinary revert path. It passed against a copy with the
#    disarm deleted, which is how it was caught. Killing the tool means signalling
#    the tool.
