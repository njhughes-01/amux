# AF-542. `amux board reviewer <id> <session>` and `amux board shepherd <id>
# <session>` handed a card to a named peer with no check that the peer could
# ever act on it. Measured 2026-09-07: 21 of 24 named reviewers on the real
# board were unreachable by construction (isolated or gone) -- each one a
# card silently stuck in `review` forever, since only that named session's
# sign-off satisfies the gate (ethos rule 3: no truthful path through for
# that name).
#
# This pins the fix: a nonexistent session is refused outright, an isolated
# one is refused unless --force, an archived-but-not-isolated one is set with
# a warning, and a lookup failure warns but still proceeds (fail-open, same
# direction as push-consent.sh's lane_state -- a probe that cannot run must
# never manufacture a false "clear", ethos rule 4).
#
# WHAT IS PINNED, both directions: the refusals must not PATCH the board, and
# every accept (ok / --force / archived / lookup-failure) must still reach
# the wire with the right reviewer/shepherd value.
#
# Runs against a throwaway listener on a random port. Nothing here can touch
# the real board.
