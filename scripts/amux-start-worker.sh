# Start every registered amux worker lane after the server is ready.
#
# AMUX-49 (2026-08-31): this used to hardcode the `amux` lane only, so a
# container reboot silently dropped every other lane (confirmed live: of 8
# registered lanes, only `amux` + `frontstage` had a running tmux session —
# `frontstage` only because someone happened to restart it by hand). This
# now iterates every lane amux itself knows about (~/.amux/sessions/*.env,
# the same source `amux start-all` reads) instead of one hardcoded name.
#
# Per-lane failures are isolated and logged, not fatal to the loop: a lane
# with its own pre-existing problem (e.g. a stale platform-specific config)
# must not take the rest of the fleet down with it — that exact shape bit
# `amux start-all` itself before INIT-2 fixed a `set -e` abort-on-first-
# failure bug in the CLI. This script doesn't depend on that CLI's own
# internal error handling; it drives the HTTP API directly per lane so a
# single failure can never truncate the loop.
# Derived, never a hardcoded user: a copy of this script on a host whose user
# was not `syseng` pointed at that user's nonexistent home, so the lane glob was
# empty and boot recovery exited 1 without being able to write this log.

#   - archived lanes (CC_ARCHIVED=1): start_session refuses them ("wake it
