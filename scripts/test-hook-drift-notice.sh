# Cells for the installed-hook drift notice in .claude/session-freshness.sh.
#
# WHY. The notice printed one fixed sentence for every kind of drift:
# "a stale guard does not announce itself — it just stops guarding". On
# 2026-08-30 the only difference between the installed amux-staged-guard and the
# checkout's was a COMMENT rewrite; both read `GUARD_VERSION = 11`, so nothing
# had stopped guarding, and the notice said it had.
#
# That is ethos rule 4 failing in the direction that costs trust: a byte diff
# fires on any edit to a hook, docs included, and a start-of-session banner that
# cries wolf every time trains lanes to skip the line — including the MISSING
# case, which is the one where a guard really is off.
#
# So the DETECTOR is unchanged (bytes are still the only thing that can see
# "this is not the file in the checkout"); what changed is that the notice now
# says which of the three situations it measured. The cells below pin all three
# plus the anti-vacuity control, because a banner nobody can fail is a banner
# nobody should believe.

# These cells hardcoded `11` in three places: the expected "GUARD_VERSION 11 on
# both", the sed that manufactures a regression, and the expected "installed
# GUARD_VERSION 8 < checkout 11". GUARD_VERSION then moved to 12 (f36b35f1) and
# 13 (349a9ce4) and CI went red on all three — the sed matched nothing, so cell 3
# never even created the regression it was asserting about.
#
# Bumping 11 to 13 would defer this to the next bump. The number belongs to
# scripts/git-hooks/amux-staged-guard, so read it from there: a fixture that
# hand-types a producer's output is a copy of a BELIEF about the producer and
# cannot survive it changing (AF-437).
