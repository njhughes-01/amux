# test-hook-version-marker.sh — AF-431 / MR-44. install-hooks.sh classified a
# divergent vendored hook by grepping its `# guard-features:` tokens as bare,
# case-insensitive SUBSTRINGS anywhere in the file. mixpeek-research measured
# the cost: mixpeek's GUARD_VERSION 4 copy of amux-staged-guard, ~215 lines and
# five versions behind, read as "carries every canonical feature — left
# untouched" because the literal AMUX-2946 sits at its line 75 in an unrelated
# comment about retired ports. A token a file can satisfy by TALKING about a
# feature cannot certify it HAS the feature, and it fails in the reassuring
# direction.
#
# Marker format mirrors mixpeek's dc21a0d489 so both repos agree: exactly one
# anchored integer, `^GUARD_VERSION = N` or `^# guard-version: N`.
#
# THE CELL THAT MATTERS is 2: a stale copy carrying EVERY token must still read
# STALE. Without it this suite would pass with the numeric check deleted, since
# a stale copy usually lacks tokens too.
