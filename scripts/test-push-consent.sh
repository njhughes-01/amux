# Proof for scripts/push-consent.sh (AF-548).
#
# The range c6876cf1..8a701877 is the real push this script was built from and
# it is permanent history on origin, so every number below is checkable by
# anyone. Deliberately asserts on the PURE-GIT half (commit counts, Rust/no-Rust
# split, which shas carry no Rust) rather than on live /api/sessions isolation,
# because a lane's isolation is a fact about today and would make this a test of
# the fleet rather than of the script.
#
# The PASS line is COMPUTED from the cell count, never written: a summary a
# script hardcodes cannot disagree with its own run, so it reads as measured
# while being unable to fail.
# `-e` IS THE GUARD, and it is the only one that works here (AF-560).
#
# A missing command returns 127, and `set -e` aborts on it with bash's own
# message naming the helper AND the line:
#     scripts/test-push-consent.sh: line 103: check_not: command not found
# then exit 127. No verdict is printed, so there is no false PASS.

# WHY NOT `command_not_found_handle`, which is the obvious answer and was my
# first one: it does not exist before bash 4.0, and this machine runs
# 3.2.57 (the macOS system bash, which `#!/usr/bin/env bash` resolves to).
# I shipped that handler in 40938593 and it was INERT — deleting a check
# helper still produced "PASS (9 outcome cells)" with two cells never run,
# which is the original bug surviving its own fix. Measured, not assumed:
#     bash -c 'command_not_found_handle(){ echo FIRED; }; nosuch' -> no FIRED
# Kept out rather than kept as a no-op: a guard that cannot fire on the
# platform it ships to is worse than an absent one, because the next reader
# believes the case is covered.
#
# The history: two `check_not` calls were added here before that helper
# existed in this file. bash printed "check_not: command not found" to stderr
# and the suite reported PASS with two of nine assertions never executed.
# The verdict was COMPUTED from $CELLS, so even the honest-summary discipline
# did not catch it — nobody reads stderr when the last line says PASS.
