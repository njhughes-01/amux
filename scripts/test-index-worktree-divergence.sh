# AF-195 — the staged-guard must refuse a commit whose staged bytes are not the
# bytes on disk, and must NOT refuse the three forms where they cannot differ.
#
# WHY A SHELL TEST AND NOT A PYTHON UNIT TEST. The property under test is about
# what GIT does before the hook runs: `git commit -a` and `git commit -- <path>`
# build a TEMPORARY index from the working tree and point GIT_INDEX_FILE at it,
# so `git diff` inside the hook compares the worktree against that temp index
# and finds nothing. That is the whole reason those forms are safe, and it is a
# claim about git's behaviour that no amount of reading the hook can settle.
# Calling the function directly would test a paraphrase of the shipped path.
#
# It drives the SHIPPED scripts/git-hooks/amux-staged-guard, installed as a real
# pre-commit hook in a scratch repo, invoked by real `git commit`.
#
# AMUX_VERIFIED_SOLO is set throughout. That is not a workaround: the divergence
# check is specified to run BEFORE the foreign-work overrides and to outrank
# them, so setting it isolates this check from the server-backed half AND
# asserts the ordering claim at the same time. If the ordering ever regresses,
# every blocking cell here goes green and the test fails loudly.
#
# Exit 0 = pass, 1 = failure.
set -uo pipefail
# Fixtures are HERMETIC: no template from the developer's own git config.
# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.
