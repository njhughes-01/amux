# RESURRECTION half. Rebuilds the incident shape in a scratch repo: an archive
# campaign moves an entry into FRUSTRATIONS_ARCHIVE.md, then a stale republish
# re-adds it to FRUSTRATIONS.md with the archive untouched. The union (loss)
# rule passes that by construction; the resurrection check must refuse it —
# while the campaign itself, an innocent append over inherited duplication,
# and the deliberate re-open path all still pass, and the deletion half keeps
# refusing what it always refused.

# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.
