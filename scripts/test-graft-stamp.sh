# AMUX-3782 — a GRAFTED commit must be as attributable as a committed one.
#
# `git commit-tree` is plumbing: it fires no hooks, so `prepare-commit-msg`
# never runs and a graft-pushed commit carries no `Amux-Session` trailer. On a
# shared checkout where every lane commits as the same git author, that trailer
# is the only discriminator, so the workflow used to land work past a peer's
# dirty worktree is the workflow that erases who did it.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-26, last 400 commits on each repo's origin/main:
#   amux     380/400 present (95%) — lanes here commit with `git commit`
#   mixpeek  202/400 present (50%) — the repo where grafting is routine
# The absence is not spread evenly; it concentrates in the graft path.
#
# THE FIX IS NOT A NEW SNIPPET. mixpeek-homepage-claude proposed adding a
# `git interpret-trailers --trailer "Amux-Session: $AMUX_SESSION"` line to the
# graft recipe, tested and working. It works, and it is a SECOND PRODUCER of
# the trailer block — which had already drifted before it was written: AMUX-3780
# added `Amux-Conversation` to the hook, and a hand-rolled one-liner stamps only
# the field its author knew about. Cell D is exactly that discriminator; it is
# green for "call the shipped hook" and red for the snippet.
#
# The hook already takes a message file and stamps it in place, so the recipe is
# to run the same code git would have run:
#
#     .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg "$MSG"
#     SHA=$(git commit-tree -p origin/main -F "$MSG" "$TREE")
#
# This test installs the TRACKED hook into a throwaway fixture and then invokes
# that literal recipe path, so it pins the string a reader will copy rather than
# a paraphrase of it.
#
# CELL B IS THE LOAD-BEARING CONTROL. Every other cell asserts a trailer is
# present; without B, a version of this file that stamped nothing and read the
# trailer off the wrong object would pass. B omits the hook step and requires
# the trailer to be ABSENT.
#
# Exit 0 = pass, 1 = failure.
set -euo pipefail
# Fixtures are HERMETIC: no template from the developer's own git config.
# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.
