# Launch one playwright-mcp lane instance, for use as the ExecStart of a
# systemd template unit (amux-playwright-mcp@.service.template). The
# instance name (systemd's %i) is "<lane>-<port>", e.g. "frontstage-8931" —
# split here rather than passed as two separate unit parameters because
# systemd template units only carry one %i.
#
# `exec` replaces this shell with the npx/node process so systemd tracks
# the real MCP server as the service's main PID (required for
# Type=simple + Restart=always to behave correctly — otherwise systemd
# tracks this wrapper shell, which exits immediately while node lingers,
# and a crash of the real process would not trigger a restart).

# check to conclude the browser "has" IPv6 and route it to an AAAA-only
# challenge host, which is then genuinely unreachable (confirmed 2026-08-28:
# brunhild.challenges.cloudflare.com has no A record at all). --disable-ipv6
# makes Chromium stop reporting IPv6 capability entirely, so Cloudflare falls

# PINNED, NOT @latest (AMUX-3989).
#
# `@latest` means an upstream lifecycle change lands on this fleet with no amux
# commit, no review and no way to bisect. Measured 2026-08-31: the npx cache on
# this box holds 0.0.68 — what the fleet has actually been running — while
# `@latest` resolves to 0.0.79. Eleven versions of drift waiting for whichever
# lane next triggered a cold npx, and browser lifecycle is precisely where an
# upstream change is expensive (see the epic AMUX-3988).
#
# Pinned to the version already in service, so this commit changes NOTHING about
# today's behaviour. That is the point: an upgrade is now a deliberate one-line
# commit somebody reviews, rather than a side effect of when a cache expired.
#
# To upgrade: bump the version here, restart one instance, verify, then the rest.
