"""AMUX-3464: recovery sweep for pre-AF-137 auto-filed reports.

Those cards were filed with session=NULL, invisible to auto-pickup (AF-137),
and their subjects may have long since recovered. This sweep re-runs each
report class's own check against the LIVE instruments and:

  - RETIRES recovered reports: attributed PATCH to discarded with the
    re-check evidence appended. The server's discard transition clears the
    autofix idem row (the re-arm hook, board.rs), so recurrence files fresh
    — retirement never suppresses future signal. REFUSE to run if the
    running server predates that hook.
  - ROUTES still-live reports to AMUX_AUTOFIX_SESSION's lane, capped per
    run (the migration-event caution from AF-137: never discharge the
    backlog into one queue at once).
  - LEAVES anything it cannot honestly decide (no traffic on a slow-endpoint
    report is quiet, not recovered — "stopped happening is not fixed").

board.autofix_cards_are_dispatchable is the progress meter: green when the
backlog is dispositioned. Doctrine note: this is a WORKER's judgment pass
with evidence recorded per card, not a detector auto-closing on green — the
distinction autofix.rs's own tests pin.
