# AMUX-3797 — scripts/unbuilt-commits.sh must tell "never compiled" from
# "compiled", and must REFUSE rather than guess when it cannot tell.
#
# CELL 3 IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE. With no builder log, the naive implementation
# reports every commit as unbuilt — absence read as emptiness, the failure this
# repo has paid for repeatedly. It must exit 2 and report no count at all.
#
# CELL 2 encodes the subtlety that produced this card's first draft: a SKIP line
# names a sha and does NOT mean it was built. 962c15d7 was logged SKIP four
# seconds AFTER the provenance file recorded it as built, and reading that SKIP
# as "never built" is what put a wrong mechanism on the card. A sha that appears
# ONLY on a SKIP line was seen, deferred, and never compiled — unbuilt.
#
# Runs against a fixture repo and a fake log; touches no real builder state.
# Exit 0 = pass, 1 = failure.

# Fixtures are HERMETIC: no template from the developer's own git config.
# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.
