# AMUX-3682. A hook must install from the COMMITTED blob, never the worktree.
#
# Both hooks' comments in install.sh said "installed from the repo, so the
# committed copy is authoritative" and then copied `$SCRIPT_DIR/...` — the
# working tree. On a shared checkout somebody is nearly always mid-edit, so
# `./install.sh` shipped whatever uncommitted bytes were on disk to the fleet.
#
# Measured 2026-08-24, two incidents on the same arc:
#   hooks.report_hook_matches_committed   08-20 06:18 -> 08-24 16:25  4d10h
#   hooks.shared_guard_matches_committed  08-20 06:51 -> 08-24 12:36  4d05h
# 32 minutes apart, four days each, both resolved only when a DIFFERENT lane
# committed that file for an unrelated reason.
#
# THE DIRTY-WORKTREE CELL IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. A clean checkout installs the
# same bytes either way, so a test that only covers it passes against the OLD
# code and proves nothing — that is the wrong-layer trap, and it is the easy
# test to write. The cell below dirties the file first, which is the state both
# incidents were in.
