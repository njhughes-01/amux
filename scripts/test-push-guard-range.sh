# AEAB-48 — the push-guard must count what a push ACTUALLY ships, in both
# directions.
#
# The bug this pins: `remote_sha..local_sha` reads as "what this push adds" and
# is that ONLY while the push fast-forwards. Rebase a branch onto current
# origin/main — the hygiene everyone is told to do — and the old remote tip
# stops being an ancestor, so the range widens to every commit rebased ONTO.
# Measured 2026-08-22 on a branch adding 2 commits: 28 in the old range, 2 in
# the correct one, all 26 of the difference provably already on origin. The
# guard refused with "would ship 22 commit(s) authored by another session".
#
# The reason a HALF test is not enough, and it is the whole point of this file:
# a "fix" that made the guard return nothing at all would pass the rebase case
# perfectly. So case B pins the guard still REFUSING a genuinely foreign commit
# that origin does not have. One case proves the fix, the other proves the fix
# did not hollow the guard out; either alone is theatre.
#
# Runs the SHIPPED hook against real throwaway repos rather than restating its
# logic — the hook is what ships, and simulating what you believe it does
# cannot catch it doing something else.
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure. Wired into .github/workflows/checks.yml.

# ── J/K. OWNER CONSENT for an ISOLATED worker (Ethan, 2026-08-23) ───────────
# An isolated raw-agent worker has the harness stripped and refuses peer sends,
# so its consent CANNOT be obtained: "ask that session to push" is unaskable and
# the two-field consent form needs a yes nobody can give. `:owner` is the exit,
# and the property that keeps it from being a second blanket override is that it
# is REFUSED for a worker you could simply have asked. K is that control, and it
# is the case that fails if the isolation check is dropped.
#
# These two consult the LIVE server for isolation (fail-closed on any doubt), so
# they use real lane names: `desktop` is isolated on this machine, `other-lane`
# is not a lane at all and must therefore be refused.
# The fixture the probe reads. HOME is already redirected to $TMP/fakehome by
# run_hook_consent, so this is hermetic: no server, no real ~/.amux, and the
# same file layout the server itself reads (~/.amux/sessions/<name>.env).
