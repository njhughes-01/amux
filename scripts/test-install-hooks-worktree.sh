# scripts/install-hooks.sh must work FROM A LINKED WORKTREE, and nothing tested it.
#
# CLAUDE.md tells every session to develop in a worktree and never in the checkout
# the builder watches. install-hooks.sh resolved its destination as
# "$ROOT/.git/hooks" — and in a linked worktree `.git` is a FILE, not a directory,
# so every install died with
#
#     install: cannot stat '<worktree>/.git/hooks/pre-commit': Not a directory
#
# AFTER the script had already printed its first `ok` line. So the sanctioned way
# to work was also the one way you could not install the secret scan, the
# staged-guard, the push guard or the Amux-Session stamp — and the half-run reads
# as having started fine.
#
# The script already knew the shape: its --all sweep skips linked worktrees BY
# NAME, and its own WARN tells OTHER hooks to resolve guards with
# `git rev-parse --git-path hooks`. Only its own install path still spelled the
# path by hand, which is why a test belongs here rather than a comment.
#
# CASE B IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF. A test that only asserts "installing works"
# passes against the pre-fix script the moment it is run from a NORMAL checkout,
# which is how this went unnoticed: the defect is invisible unless the fixture is
# a worktree. So B rebuilds the pre-fix behaviour (the hardcoded path) and asserts
# it FAILS on the same fixture. Confirmed before wiring in: with B's mutation
# applied to the shipped script, A fails and B passes.
