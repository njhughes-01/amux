# amux report hook (AMUX-2829). Reads Claude Code's hook payload on STDIN,
# extracts the transcript path, and reports REAL context usage with the state.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the hooks used to POST a fixed body with no tokens, so the
# server never knew any lane's context size. Nothing could emit ContextLow, so
# orchestrator/compaction.rs's policy was NEVER CALLED and lanes ran to the wall
# and stopped. Ethan, 2026-08-10: "theres no reason amux should ever stop."
#
# Fails open in every direction: no stdin, no transcript, no python -> report
# the state anyway with tokens omitted. A liveness report is worth more than a
# token count, and this must never be the reason a hook fails.
# MODE is either a main-turn state or one of the two event-driven subagent
# lifecycle modes. Claude Code exposes SubagentStart/SubagentStop directly;
# routing both through this one canonical reporter keeps attribution,
# conversation adoption, endpoint resolution and failure logging identical.
#
# ATE-45: lifecycle delivery is a durable FIFO, and main-turn state is a
# durable latest-wins row. A server rebuild used to turn either into a one-shot
# http=000 log line, leaving the authoritative state false until another hook
# happened or its trust window expired. The detached drain below survives the
# hook invocation and retries the same row after response loss. Lifecycle edges
# keep order; a newer main state replaces the older row so replayed idle can
# never overwrite a later active turn. The hook still always exits zero: amux
# must never block the model.

# {"subagent":"stop"} since AMUX-3048, and `FleetSignals::subagents_working`
# has read the resulting count ever since. NOTHING EVER SENT ONE. Measured
# 2026-09-02: `subagents_live` was null for 125 of 125 lanes, so the durable
# signal that whole cluster (AMUX-2646/2904/2959/2952/3022/3030/3047) was
# built around had a reader, a store, a test and no producer — the same shape
# this file's own `active_model` comment describes thirty lines below.
#
# That is also why the count could not simply be switched on: an mtime cannot
# tell "thinking, will write in 90s" from "finished 30s ago", and with no
# events there was nothing better to prefer. Two live specimens, one in each
# direction, on the same afternoon: tubescience read IDLE while blocked on a
# background agent, and mvs-pitr read WORKING with an AGENTS badge over an
# empty composer, its subagents long finished and their transcripts still
# inside the 240s window.
#
# THE MATCHER IS ANCHORED (`^(Task|Agent)$`) and that is load-bearing. Claude
# Code matches the matcher against the TOOL NAME as an unanchored regex, and
# `TaskOutput` and `TaskStop` are separate tools you call WHILE polling
# background work — a bare `Task|Agent` matches both, so every poll of a running
# agent would have incremented the count again and pinned the lane WORKING. That
# is the exact false-WORKING this card is fixing, reintroduced by its own fix.
#
# A subagent event says nothing about the main turn, so this branch skips the
# transcript/token extraction entirely and posts only the lifecycle fact. It
# reuses the POST + failure-logging below rather than adding a second sender,
# so a refused subagent event is visible in the same log as every other
# refused report.
# BOTH SPELLINGS ARE ACCEPTED, and that is not politeness. Two independent
# implementations of this producer landed on the same day: this one uses
# `subagent:start` (colon) and #182 used `subagent-start` (hyphen). The
# settings.json wired on this box and verified live calls the COLON form, so
# dropping it would silently stop the counting — the hook would post
# {"state":"subagent:start"}, the server would refuse it, and the only symptom
# would be lanes reading WORKING for four minutes again.
