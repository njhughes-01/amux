# AF-234 — the append-only push guard must not accuse a FORK contributor of
# deleting work they never touched.
#
# The bug this pins: for a NEW branch the guard has no remote ref to compare
# against, so it uses the push remote's `main` TIP. That is right on the shared
# checkout, where `origin` IS the authoritative history. On a fork, `origin` is
# a MIRROR that lags upstream — 251 commits, for @tsukimiya on PR #157. Entries
# are ARCHIVED out of frustrations.md into frustrations-archive.md upstream, so
# a stale mirror still holds lines that legitimately MOVED, and a branch cut
# from `upstream/main` reads as DELETING all of them. Their branch touched one
# unrelated file and `git diff upstream/main -- frustrations.md` was empty.
#
# THREE CELLS, because the obvious fix is worse than the bug. Making the guard
# quiet on a fork, or comparing against a merge-base, would pass cell A
# perfectly and hollow the guard out — a merge-base is old exactly when the
# graft is old, which is the case the guard exists for. So B pins that a branch
# NOT descending from the authoritative tip is still refused, and C pins the
# shared-checkout path (no `upstream` remote) unchanged. A alone is theatre.
#
# Runs the SHIPPED guard against real throwaway repos, driven through its real
# stdin ref-line protocol — `--check <base> <head>` bypasses the base SELECTION
# that this fix changes, so a test using it could not fail against the old code.
#
# PUSH_GUARD_HOOK points the cells at a different copy, to confirm cell A
# actually fails against the code it was written for:
#   git show <sha>^:scripts/git-hooks/append-only-push-guard > /tmp/pre-guard
#   PUSH_GUARD_HOOK=/tmp/pre-guard bash scripts/test-push-guard-fork-base.sh
#
# Exit 0 = all pass, 1 = a failure.
