# Cells for the observed-edits walk root (AMUX-3920, handed over from MHC-527).
#
# THE DEFECT. The harness reports the SESSION cwd and the hook walked exactly
# that. When cwd is a SUBDIRECTORY of a shared checkout, every edit above it
# produced no record at all. MHC-527's control, one Bash call writing two files
# in one repo: `homepage/scripts/.probe` recorded, `scripts/.probe` not, hook
# logged n=1. In that session 13 of 16 committed paths were above cwd — 81%
# structurally unobservable — and the staged guard, correctly reading "NO
# session has an edit record for this", asked for VERIFIED_SOLO on three commits
# and ALLOW_FOREIGN on two. Overriding a guard that is right most of the time is
# how a fleet learns to wave it through.
#
# THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPES THE FIX. amux is 2,222 files and walks in 0.03s;
# ~/Dev/mixpeek is ~640,000 and sits right on the 1.5s budget — 2.5-2.9s COLD,
# ~1.0s once the filesystem cache is warm. (My first figure was 2.54s and I
# reported it without noting it was a cold walk; alternating the arms three times
# is what separated the two.) On a box that compiles continuously the cold case
# is not rare, and mixpeek-homepage-claude confirms every recent run on their
# lane carries TRUNCATED=budget.
#
# So a walk that starts at the repo root can exhaust the budget before ever
# reaching the session's own directory — trading a known blind spot for an
# unpredictable one.
#
# Hence: cwd first, then the rest of the repo with the remaining budget, and a
# distinct marker when the budget or cap cuts. Never less coverage than before,
# more when it fits, and the shortfall is named rather than silent.
