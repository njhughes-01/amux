# AEAB-12 — the auto-builder must SAY when it is about to install a revision that
# is not on main.
#
# It rebuilds whenever the build source's local HEAD moves, on any branch, and the
# server self-adopts within ~5s. That permissiveness is deliberate and stays — this
# machine has survived weeks pinned to an unmerged fix branch. The defect is that a
# deliberate pin and an ACCIDENTAL feature branch were byte-identical to the
# builder. On 2026-08-17 a commit made on a branch inside the build source served
# the whole fleet for 9h42m with no CI and no review, while the same condition
# stopped the machine tracking upstream. Nothing looked wrong anywhere.
#
# Runs the SHIPPED script (via its provenance-only seam, which stops before the
# cargo build) against REAL git repos, so this exercises the real predicate rather
# than a restatement of it.
#
# The on-main cases are the load-bearing ones: a builder that shouted on every
# build would be ignored within a day, and the whole value is that the line only
# appears when something is actually off.

# Fixtures are HERMETIC: no template from the developer's own git config.
# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.
