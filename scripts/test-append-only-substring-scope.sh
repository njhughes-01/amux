# test-append-only-substring-scope.sh — AF-432. The guard's classifier tests
# membership as a SUBSTRING over the pushed union, so a deleted line that some
# LONGER line happens to contain was rescued SILENTLY, and exit 0 was an
# unqualified claim about the file while resting, for that line, on nothing.
#
# The specimen: repairing AF-430 dropped `CARD: AF-10`, a line in no other file,
# and the guard passed without a word because `CARD: AF-106` contains it.
#
# The report must be PRECISE or it is worthless. Cell 2 is the one that decides
# that: an ordinary archive MOVE rescues every moved line by exact whole-line
# match elsewhere in the union, and reporting those too would fire the note on
# every retirement and teach skipping it. Measured on the real 55-commit push
# range that archived 47 entries, this reports exactly one line.
#
# Each cell writes BOTH files outright rather than restoring one from a commit.
# That is not stylistic: this repo's shared-checkout guard reads the tool call,
# cannot see a `cd` into a scratch repo, and refuses a restore naming a path a
# peer has edited — correctly, on the information it has (AF-435).

# Fixtures are HERMETIC: no template from the developer's own git config.
# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.
