# The contention wrapper must report the WORKTREE, on both arms (AF-356).
#
# WHY. The wrapper measured one of the two ways a peer reddens your suite. It
# sampled the auto-builder's lock and printed "NOT build contention", which reads
# as "therefore your bug" — while the other cause, a peer's UNCOMMITTED SOURCE in
# the shared worktree, produces the identical symptom: a red in a module you never
# opened that passes on rerun.
#
# Measured live 2026-08-31: `amux` got one failure in gate_table_matches_python,
# read the clean verdict, concluded ETXTBSY, and carried that into a verification
# request as its stated weakest evidence line. The real cause was a peer's
# uncommitted ItemType::Decision sitting in the tree.
#
# BOTH ARMS is the load-bearing part. A caveat inside one branch is one the other
# branch's reader never sees (ethos rule 1), and a dirty tree explains a red just
# as well when the builder WAS running.
#
# `cargo` is stubbed via PATH so no real suite runs; the wrapper's own git calls
# run against a throwaway repo, never this checkout.
set -euo pipefail
# Fixtures are HERMETIC: no template from the developer's own git config.
# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.

# truncation never reached the running shell. A control that cannot fail is worse
# than none, so it is gone rather than relabelled.

# This is a SOURCE assertion instead: the preamble exists, and no executable
# statement precedes it. Position is the property that matters — a snapshot taken
# after any other work is a snapshot of a file that could already have moved. It
# cannot pass against a paraphrase, since it reads the shipped file, and it fails
