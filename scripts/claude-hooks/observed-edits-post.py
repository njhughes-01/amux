# observed-edits POST half (AF-123). After every Bash command: report files
# under the command's cwd whose mtime moved since the PRE marker, as OBSERVED
# edit records the staged-guard merges at firsthand rank. See the PRE half's
# header for why this exists (the firsthand=0 lane bias) and why observation

# TRACKED SOURCE: scripts/claude-hooks/observed-edits-post.py. Installed to
# ~/.amux/hooks/ and wired in ~/.claude/settings.json (PostToolUse, matcher
# "Bash"). Fail-open always; hard wall-clock budget so a huge tree cannot
# slow every command. Writes one line per report to
# ~/.amux/hooks/state/observed-edits.log — the verify-by-what-it-WROTE marker
# (AMUX-2538's lesson: a hook that looks wired and never ran is invisible
# without one).

# Pruned for CORRECTNESS, not for speed (AMUX-3920, mixpeek-cicd's specimen).
#
# The speed argument does not survive measurement and I am recording that rather
# than quietly acting on it: broadening this set drops ~/Dev/mixpeek from 640,355
# files to 589,713, only 7.9%, and once the filesystem cache is warm the walk
# takes ~1.0s either way. My earlier 2.54s figure was a COLD walk; alternating
# the two arms three times gives 0.94/1.01s broadened against 1.04/1.08s current,
# i.e. noise.
#
# The reason to prune these is that a cache write is not a lane's edit. On
# 2026-08-30 mixpeek-cicd logged `n=3` in which TWO of the three recorded paths
# were `.pytest_cache` and `.ruff_cache` entries. Those become edit records, and
# an edit record is what the staged guard reads to decide who touched a file — so
# a test run mints attribution for files no guard should care about. `.cache`-
# prefixed names were already excluded; `.pytest_cache` and `.ruff_cache` are not
# `.cache`-prefixed, which is why they slipped through.

    # partial one, none. MHC-527's positive control, one Bash call writing two
    # files in one repo: `homepage/scripts/.probe` recorded, `scripts/.probe`
    # not, hook logged n=1.
    #
    # The cost is not friction. That session committed 16 paths, 13 above its
    # cwd, so 81% of the work was structurally unobservable — and the staged
    # guard, correctly reading "NO session has an edit record for this", asked
    # for AMUX_VERIFIED_SOLO on three commits and AMUX_ALLOW_FOREIGN on two.
    # Routinely overriding a guard that is right most of the time trains the
    # fleet to wave it through, and the next time it correctly names a peer's
    # work the muscle memory is already there.
    #
    # CWD FIRST, THEN THE REST OF THE REPO. Measured 2026-08-30 with this file's
    # own PRUNE set: amux is 2,222 files in 0.03s, but ~/Dev/mixpeek — the
    # monorepo this card is about — is 640,353 files in 2.54s against a 1.5s
    # budget. A naive widening therefore TRUNCATES on the repo it exists to fix,
    # and a truncated walk that starts at the repo root can run out of budget
    # before it ever reaches the session's own directory. That would trade a
    # known blind spot for an unpredictable one.
    #
    # Ordering the roots fixes it without touching the budget: cwd is walked
    # first, so the coverage that worked before is never lost, and the rest of
    # the repo is walked with whatever budget remains. Strictly more than before,
    # never less, and the shortfall is named rather than silent.
    # realpath BOTH roots. On macOS /var is a symlink to /private/var, so the
    # cwd the harness reports and the toplevel git prints can name the same
    # directory with different strings — and then the `seen` dedupe below misses
    # and every file under cwd is counted twice. Found by the n=3 in a two-file
    # control.

    # Widening the root beyond cwd is UNSOUND, and the coverage it bought and the
    # corruption it caused are the same operation. mtime says a file was written
    # in this window; it does not say BY WHOM. cwd was the only thing bounding
    # that smear, and removing it let every lane claim every other lane's
    # uncommitted files.
    #
    # Live specimen, mixpeek-homepage-claude, with the git enumeration that made
    # the widening complete:
    #   byo-ray n=2 sent src=git paths=FRUSTRATIONS.md,research/shared-checkout/...md
    # byo-ray's cwd is research/byo-ray/. The second path is another lane's file,
    # written 22s earlier and never touched by byo-ray. The staged guard reads
    # exactly these records to decide ownership, so this is worse than the blind
    # spot it fixed — the module's own doctrine already says cross-linking is
    # strictly worse than staying blind.
    #
    # Reverting the git enumeration alone was NOT enough; reproduced afterwards
    # with a two-lane scratch repo, laneA claiming laneB/peers.txt through the
    # os.walk widening. So the root goes back to cwd.
    #
    # WHAT SURVIVES from that work, because none of it depends on the wider root:
    # the TRUNCATED marker, the tool-cache prune, realpath'd roots, repo-relative
    # log paths. What does not survive is the coverage claim, and AMUX-3933 now
