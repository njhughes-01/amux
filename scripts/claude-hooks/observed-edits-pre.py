# observed-edits PRE half (AF-123). Marks t0 before every Bash command so the
# POST half can report files whose mtime moved during it. Observed, not
# parsed: 75% of AF-27 staged-guard blocks hit lanes with firsthand=0, because
# bypass-permissions lanes are told to edit through Bash and no pathlike regex
# can see a write spelled inside a heredoc or aimed at an extensionless file
# (the specimen: a python heredoc rewriting `amux`).
#
# TRACKED SOURCE: scripts/claude-hooks/observed-edits-pre.py. Installed to
# ~/.amux/hooks/ and wired in ~/.claude/settings.json (PreToolUse, matcher
# "Bash"). Fail-open always: a hook that can block Bash fleet-wide must never
# have a failure mode of its own.

    Scoped to amux- prefixed panes, so a human's own tmux session (or no tmux
    at all) still resolves to "" and takes the existing no-op path.

    The tmux CALL FAILING is a different case from tmux CLEANLY SAYING "not an
    amux- pane" (amux-frustrations auditing MR-43, 2026-08-25): both used to
    return "" identically, so a real lane whose tmux call merely errored or
    timed out lost its PRE marker exactly like a human shell, with no trace to
    count. Logged to the same observed-edits.log the POST half writes, under
    session "UNKNOWN", so pre- and post-half failures of this kind land in one
