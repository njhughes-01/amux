# amux fleet cold-start — bring every non-archived worker back up after a reboot.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# On 2026-08-29 the machine restarted and 56 of the fleet's 58 non-archived
# workers stayed down until a human noticed and started them by hand. Nothing was
# broken in the sense of an error being raised: nothing had ever been responsible
# for this. launchd brought back the four amux SERVICES it knows about
# (com.amux.server-rs, its builder, the watchdog, cert-renew) and the watchdog
# supervises the server only, by design and with an explicit rationale. The
# WORKERS — the 56 processes that are the actual point of the fleet — had no
# owner at boot at all. The dashboard showed them registered, described, holding
# 69 cards in `doing`, and not running.
#
# That is the gap this file closes. It is deliberately the smallest thing that
# can close it: wait for the server, then call the one bulk-start verb, then say
# what happened.
#
# WHY IT WAITS FOR THE SERVER
#
# A worker's whole value is that it can reach the API — its board cards, its
# memory, its identity. `amux start` injects AMUX_URL into every worker it
# spawns, resolving it through `amux url`, and workers whose provider is
# codex/ollama/gemini have their launch DELEGATED to the server outright. Racing
# the server means those workers launch against a base that is not answering yet.
# So we wait, with a bounded timeout, and we start the fleet either way — a
# claude-provider worker that comes up before the server recovers on its own is
# better than a fleet that stayed down because a health check was slow.
#
# WHY NOT KeepAlive
#
# This is a cold-start, not a supervisor. Restarting a worker that a human
# deliberately stopped would be amux deciding something that is the human's to
# decide (ethos rule 8). It runs once, at login, and exits.

# Wait for /health. Report which way it ended — "waited and gave up" and "came up

# different ones when a worker fails, so the log has to distinguish them.
# The endpoint is `/health`, NOT `/api/health` — the latter is a 404. This
# mattered because the first version of this loop tested `curl -sk ... >/dev/null`
# and read CURL'S EXIT STATUS, which is 0 for a perfectly-delivered 404. So it
# declared the server up, instantly, against an endpoint that does not exist, and
# would have declared it up just as fast with the server stopped. That is the
# amux-wide "read the BODY, never the exit code" rule (see cmd_fresh) in the one
# place where believing it costs the whole fleet: a false "up" here is what sends
# codex/ollama/gemini workers at a server that is not answering.

# empty string, and `curl -o ""` failed on every iteration — so the health probe
# could never succeed and the boot logged "server never answered" no matter how
# healthy the server was.
#
# It went unseen because this box is macOS and the failure is silent on the arm
# that works. Caught by test-fleet-boot-divergence.sh running on a Linux CI
# runner: every POSITIVE cell failed and every NEGATIVE cell passed, which is the
