# Apply and revert a single mutation SAFELY on a shared checkout.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (AMUX-3670, 2026-08-24). This repo asks for mutation testing
# on every check — "confirm the mutation LANDED before reading the suite's
# colour" — and the obvious harness is:
#
#     cp $F /tmp/orig ; <mutate> ; <run tests> ; cp /tmp/orig $F
#
# That restore is a WHOLE-FILE WRITE, and on a shared checkout it is
# indistinguishable from `git checkout -- $F` as far as a concurrent peer is
# concerned. Measured: at 15:45 it reverted mixpeek-research's in-flight
# `fn chrome_launch_args` out of browser.rs while keeping the call site that had
# arrived inside the mutate/restore window, breaking `cargo check` for both
# lanes. Twice in a row, because the harness ran twice. The same harness had run
# roughly a dozen times that day across five files; every one of them was a
# chance to do the same to somebody.
#
# So: mutate by EXACT STRING, revert by the inverse exact string. Only the bytes
# being mutated are ever written, so a peer editing any other part of the file is
# untouched.
#
# The uniqueness check is not politeness, it is the discipline: a mutation that
# matched 0 places and a suite that stayed green look identical, and "the tests
# have no coverage here" is the wrong conclusion you reach from it.
#
#   scripts/mutate.sh apply  <file> <old> <new>
#   scripts/mutate.sh revert <file> <old> <new>   # same args, swapped internally
#
# Exit 0 on success, 1 if the target is absent or not unique.

# ── THIS SCRIPT MUST NOT MUTATE ITSELF (AF-440) ─────────────────────────────
#
# Measured 2026-09-03, twice in five minutes, on this file. `run` applies the
# mutation, executes the command, and reverts from a trap — but bash reads a
# script by BYTE OFFSET as it executes, so rewriting the file underneath the
# running interpreter shifts every offset after the edit. The revert never
# happened. Both times the file was left MUTATED, `bash -n` passed, and the
# damage surfaced only as the NEXT invocation refusing with "the replacement
# already occurs 1 time(s)" — which reads as a bad argument, not as a corrupted
# file.
#
# That is AF-368's mechanism arriving inside the tool whose entire purpose is to
# make mutation safe on a shared checkout. Refuse it: a self-mutation cannot be
# made safe from within the process being edited, and the tool that leaves a
# mutation behind is worse than no tool, because its failure is silent and its
# next refusal blames the caller.

# ── `run`: APPLY, TEST, REVERT IN ONE PROCESS, WITH A TRAP (AF-284) ──────────
#
# `apply` and `revert` are two invocations, so the revert is conditional on the
# CALLER surviving to make it. That is the half of the hazard this script did not
# close, and it bit on 2026-08-28: amux-frustrations ran apply, then a
# `cargo test` that hit a 10-minute tool timeout, and the revert on the next line
# of the same shell block never ran. `or(Some(0))` sat in a peer's git_guard.rs
# for ten minutes on the shared checkout. No commit took it, but only because
# nobody ran `git add -A` in the window.
#
# The byte-scoped apply/revert this script already does bounds the BLAST RADIUS.
# It cannot bound the DURATION, because a two-call API hands cleanup back to a
# caller that may die. `run` keeps both calls in one process and reverts from a
# trap, so a timeout, a Ctrl-C, a failing test or a `set -e` abort all restore.
#
# The command's exit status is preserved and returned, because the whole point is
# to read the suite's colour under the mutation.
# ── `seams`: IS ANYTHING HOLDING THESE TWO ARGUMENTS APART? (AF-438) ─────────
#
# A DIFFERENT CLASS FROM `survey`, and `survey` cannot find it. Survey asks
# whether a LINE's value matters. This asks whether two things that must AGREE
# are held together by anything but the fact that they were written together.
#
# Seven instances in one night, four of them mvs-pitr's from a different repo:
#   AF-429  a writer and a detector, each with its own green test, and a fixture
#           hand-typing the writer's output so nothing pinned the pair
#   AF-437  a deriver and four readers of the same env var name
#   AF-438  a resolver and a message, both tested, the call site between them not
#   MP-100  two checks that fired on every fixture, so either could be deleted
#   MP-125  two roots that agreed on a name, so reading the wrong one survived
#   + two more where a fixture agreed with the reader and neither with the writer
#
# mvs-pitr's diagnosis is the one that made this buildable: every instance was a
# missing DIRECTION rather than a missing assertion, and none was visible from
# either side alone. A test per component passes exactly as well when the seam
# between them is broken.
#
#   scripts/mutate.sh seams <file> [--limit N] [--build <cmd>] -- <test-cmd>
#
# THE PROBE IS AN ARGUMENT SWAP. At each call site with two or more bare
# identifier arguments, exchange the first two and see what objects. Three
# outcomes, and all three are worth knowing:
#
#   HELD-BY-TYPES  the swap does not compile. The type system is the assertion,
#                  which is the best possible answer and needs no test.
#   KILLED         it compiles and a test fails. Something observes the pair.
#   SURVIVED       it compiles and every test passes. NOTHING holds these two
#                  apart — the seam is real, and this is the AF-438 shape
#                  exactly: `build(dir, ...)` and `build(&label, ...)` are both
#                  `&str`, both valid, and one of them is wrong.
#
# Pass `--build` to separate the first outcome from the second. Without it a
# compile failure and a test failure both read as KILLED, which understates the
# seams that only the compiler is holding — those are safe today and become
# unheld the moment someone widens a type.

# ── `survey`: WHICH LINES DOES THIS COMMAND ACTUALLY DEPEND ON? (AF-422) ─────
#
# `run` answers "can THIS check fail", one mutation at a time, and it only gets
# used when you already suspect the answer. The eight-instance cluster on AF-422
# is what happens when you do not suspect it: six of the eight were caught by a
# compiler, a peer, or an unrelated second look, on checks their authors had
# just written and believed. Rule 7 already names the class and names this
# script. The gap was never the knowledge, it was that running it cost enough
# thought to skip.
#
# So: point it at a file and a command, and it tells you which lines the
# command's outcome does not depend on.

# A SURVIVOR IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY A BUG. Log strings, error messages and
# defensive branches survive honestly, and a survey that demanded zero survivors
# would be the gate with no truthful path that ethos rule 3 forbids. It is a
# reading list: for each survivor, either the check does not cover it or it did
# not need covering, and only you can say which.
#
# Mutations are line-scoped and syntax-preserving, chosen so the file still
# compiles: comparison and boolean operators flip, boolean literals flip, shell
# emptiness tests invert. Each one goes through the same apply/trap-revert path
# as `run`, so the blast radius and the duration bound are identical.
#
# It SKIPS what it cannot do safely and says how many, because a survey that
# silently examined 9 of 30 lines and reported "all killed" is the exact shape
# this file exists to stop. Non-unique lines are skipped (mutate needs exactly
# one occurrence) and so is everything at or after `--stop-at`, which defaults
# to the first `#[cfg(test)]`: mutating the tests instead of the code under test

# `apply` replaced a line with `cp "$SCRIPT_DIR/$rel" "$dest"`, a string the file
# ALREADY contained in a fallback branch. So the file then held two copies, and
# `revert` correctly refused as ambiguous — printing to stderr and LEAVING THE
# FILE MUTATED. A later `bash -n` passed, the suite was re-run, and only a diff
# against git showed the installer was still carrying the mutation.
#
# That is this tool's own failure mode: the refusal was right, but it fired at
# revert time when the damage was already done and the operator had moved on.
# Checked here instead, where refusing costs nothing — and it is the same
# principle the ethos file states about a gate whose refusal destroys the
# evidence needed to satisfy it.
