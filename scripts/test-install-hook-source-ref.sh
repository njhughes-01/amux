# AF-596. Measured 2026-09-08: ~/.amux/hooks/git-shared-guard.py had that day's
# mtime and was 145 lines behind the repo, missing two SHIPPED fixes —
# 09c26abb (`\b` after a literal verb matches a hyphen, so `commit-tree` read
# as `commit`) and a391c1c6 (AF-577, refuse a `git config` write from a linked
# worktree). The installer reads committed bytes, which is right, but took them
# from HEAD; graft-push never advances local HEAD, so HEAD lags origin by an
# unbounded amount while looking authoritative.
#
# Cost: the commit-tree false positive blocked the out-of-tree graft that
# mixpeek's own CLAUDE.md prescribes as THE safe pattern on a shared checkout,
# for every lane on this box, and it was reported as a guard defect when the
# guard had been fixed the day before. Nothing anywhere said the running hook
# was old.

# Fixtures are HERMETIC: no template from the developer's own git config.
# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.
