# AMUX-3726 / AF-182 — the pre-commit gate must answer "is what I am COMMITTING
# sound", not "is the tree sound".
#
# The defect: the gate builds the WORKING TREE. On a shared checkout that cannot
# distinguish "your staged change is broken" from "a peer is mid-edit two files
# away", so a peer's uncommitted work refuses YOUR commit. Three AF-182
# instances ended in `--no-verify`, which also drops the security scan, the
# staged-guard, the append-only guard and the JS checks.
#
# `_amux_staged_recheck` materialises the INDEX in a worktree and re-runs the
# build there, but only when the tree is already red AND lint-blame proved
# (exit 10) that none of the offenders are staged.
#
# CELL 4 IS THE ONE THAT GOES WRONG QUIETLY. A version that always built the
# index would pass cells 1-3 perfectly and cost the fleet ~22s on EVERY commit,
# forever. So it asserts the BUILD DID NOT RUN when the re-check is not licensed.
#
# Its first draft counted WORKTREES after the call and was worthless: the trap
# removes the worktree on the way out, so the count is 1 either way. It detected
# a LEAK, not a build, while its comment claimed the opposite — and the mutation
# that removes the exit-10 gate (precisely the always-builds version) sailed
# past it. Caught by running that mutation rather than by re-reading the cell.
# The stub build now drops a marker file, so "did it build" is observable.
#
# Cargo is not invoked here: these cells drive the DECISION logic with a stub
# build command, because what is under test is when the re-check runs and what
# it concludes — not whether cargo works. The cost of a real build (~22s, and it
# does not amortise) is measured on the card, not re-measured per cell.
