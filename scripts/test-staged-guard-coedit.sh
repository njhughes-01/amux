# Cells for the co-edit warning's mtime CORROBORATION (AF-391).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The warning says a peer may have uncommitted work in a file
# you are about to commit whole. It is mtime-derived and says so, and on a
# checkout ~125 lanes share that makes the BUSIEST lane the default suspect for
# any file whose mtime moves. mixpeek-general was named as the editor of a file
# they had never opened; clearing it cost them and mixpeek-cicd a verification
# each. Their first check was the one wired here: worktree bytes already
# committed, so there is no uncommitted content to be in dispute.
#
# THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST IS THE ASYMMETRY, not the quiet. Downgrade only when
# the claim is mtime-derived AND nothing is in dispute; a transcript-backed
# co-edit, or a file with real uncommitted content, must still print in full.
# A test that only checked "it got quieter" would pass a guard that had been
# hollowed out, which is the failure this whole file family exists to prevent.
#
# Runs the SHIPPED loop body against a real git fixture, not a paraphrase.
set -euo pipefail
# Fixtures are HERMETIC: no template from the developer's own git config.
# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.

# -- (t) READER vs WRITER: trailer history settles it (MC-1561) ---------------

# whether the named session is a WRITER of the path at all. A hot shared file has
# uncommitted content, so (a) correctly declines to downgrade it, while the lane
# being named has never written a line. mixpeek-cicd was named three times in one
# session for files it had never opened, because it had PARSED one of them dozens
# of times in a shared cwd. Measured there: 9 commits that day, 9 with trailers,
# 0 naming them.
#
# THE `None` ARM IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE. History with no trailers at all must not
# read as "they never wrote it", or every repo that does not use trailers would
# silently suppress every notice.
