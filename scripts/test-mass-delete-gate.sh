# Cells for the mass-deletion gate in the pre-commit hook (AMUX-3921).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. MHC-531 found 233 tracked files absent from the shared
# ~/Dev/mixpeek worktree, all 233 still on origin/main, zero legitimate
# deletions. Nothing was staged, so nothing was armed; one `git add -A` or
# `git commit -a` by any lane would have staged all 233 and pushed them,
# removing server tests, MVS files and two security baselines from origin.
#
# `git-shared-guard.py` already refuses those commands UNCONDITIONALLY (AF-316),
# which is stronger than the conditional leg the handoff asked for — but it is
# wired as a Claude Code Bash hook, so it only sees commands a harness session
# runs. This gate is in pre-commit, which runs for every invoker.
#
# THE CONTROL MATTERS MORE THAN THE HEADLINE: an ordinary `git rm` of a few
# files must still commit with no override. A gate that taxes normal work
# teaches lanes to set the override by reflex, which removes the protection it
# was added for.
#
# Drives the scratch repo with `git -C` rather than `cd`: the shared-checkout
# guard infers the repo from the working directory and cannot see a `cd` inside
# a compound command, so a scratch `git reset` reads as a reset of the real
# tree. Its own refusal names this form as the fix.

# Fixtures are HERMETIC: no template from the developer's own git config.
# `git init` copies $HOME's init.templatedir into every new repo, so a global
# commit-msg hook (a Conventional Commits enforcer, say) lands in the throwaway
# repos below and rejects their fixture commits. 17 of this repo's test scripts
# failed that way on a machine that had one, while CI stayed green because the
# runner has no template — a test that passes only on machines configured like
# the author's. Empty means "no template", and git then creates no .git/hooks,
# so a test that installs a hook makes that directory itself.
