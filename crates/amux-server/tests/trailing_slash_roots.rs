//! A nested API root must answer the same with or without a trailing slash
//! (AMUX-4753).
//!
//! Measured on build b971a3e9, against the running server: 11 of 12 nested
//! roots answered 200 bare and 404 on the slash, because they are mounted as
//! `.nest("/api/x", Router::new().route("/", ..))` and axum 0.6 dropped
//! automatic trailing-slash redirects.
//!
//! Real clients send the slash form (12 GETs to `/api/board-lifecycle/` from
//! Python-urllib/3.11 on 2026-09-15, every one a 404), and amux disagreed with
//! itself about it: `match_route_full` trims slashes, so
//! `route.mounted_routes_answer` judged the slash form as a mounted route and
//! failed it while axum refused to serve it.
//!
//! WHY THE ASSERTION IS AGREEMENT RATHER THAN 200. A root can answer 500 in a
//! test process for its own reasons (no daemon, empty store), and pinning 200
//! would make this file red about something else entirely. The property the
//! card is about is that the two spellings reach one handler, which is true
//! whatever that handler answers.
