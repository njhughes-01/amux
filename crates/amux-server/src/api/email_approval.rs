//! Per-message human approval for worker-originated EXTERNAL email
//! (AMUX-3510 — Ethan's rule, stated twice on 2026-08-22: "we never send an
//! email to a customer before Ethan gives explicit approval" and "workers can
//! never send emails to people without explicit permissions").
//!
//! # The incident this encodes
//!
//! At 13:49:52Z the autodesk lane POSTed /api/email/reply and a 4KB message
//! reached four external Autodesk addresses on a live customer thread. Its
//! authorization was a general "do them all" about a board queue. The lane
//! had read the outbound-comms rules and had itself flagged the send as
//! needing Ethan — and still sent. Their own words in the request that led
//! here: "a rule I can talk myself past is not a control." So the control
//! lives in the API, not in worker prompts.
//!
//! # The mechanism
//!
//! A send or reply whose request carries a worker origin (X-Amux-Worker /
//! X-Amux-Session) and whose RESOLVED recipients include any address outside
//! the internal domains is refused with `code: "approval_required"` and the
//! frozen request is written to `~/.amux/email-approvals/apr_<hex>.json`.
//! A HUMAN (a request with NO worker origin — the dashboard) releases it via
//! POST /api/email/approve/{id}, which executes exactly the frozen payload:
//! one-shot (an atomic rename consumes the file, so a raced double-approve
//! loses cleanly), expiring (1h), and audited (the send-audit row carries
//! approval_id + the originating session; the refusal itself is also a
//! ledger row, so a gated send that nobody approves still left a trace).
//!
//! # What this is, honestly
//!
//! An accident guardrail, not a security boundary. Every worker on this
//! machine can read the auth token and could omit its own origin header; a
//! worker that does that is lying about its identity, which the send-audit
//! ledger already treats as a forensics flag (AMUX-1897: an unattributed
//! send cost real investigation time). The gate stops the incident class
//! that actually happened — an honest lane talking itself into a send.
//!
//! # Knobs (server.env, both optional)
//!
//! - `AMUX_INTERNAL_EMAIL_DOMAINS` — comma list of domains whose recipients
//!   need no approval. Empty by default.
//! - `AMUX_EMAIL_EXTERNAL_EXEMPT` — comma list of session names whose
//!   external sends skip the gate. DELIBERATELY EMPTY by default: gtm-ticker
//!   and refresh-house sent 26 external emails in the last 14 days and WILL
//!   start queueing approvals — that is the mandate as given, and the
//!   exemption is Ethan's one env line to write, not this code's to assume.
